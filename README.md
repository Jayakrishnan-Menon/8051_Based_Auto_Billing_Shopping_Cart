<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>There is a huge scope for improvement in this project.</p>
<p>We had faced resource constraints and deadlines to meet while making this project.</p>
<p>Not to mention, this was our first time working on an embedded system in general and an Arduino Board in particular.</p>
<p>Hence the code written for this lacks modularity, is not easily understandable and the system runs quite slow.</p>
<p>However, we could achieve some level of success and we learnt a lot during the design and implementation of this project.</p>
